            Yoga is a mind and body practice. Various styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation.  It involves movement, meditation, and breathing techniques to promote mental and physical well-being. Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility. Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength. Meditation can also reduce the areas of anxiety, chronic pain, depression, heart disease and high blood pressure. Relaxation is a process that decreases the effects of stress on your mind and body.
